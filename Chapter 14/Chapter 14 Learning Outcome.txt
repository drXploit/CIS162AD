What is the purpose of a SQL select statement?
The SQL SELECT statement is a retrieval command that will get rows from a table specified within the command itself.

Define DataSets.
DataSets are objects populated by the data adapter which contain the retrieved results from the query so that the connection to the database isn't always live.

What advantages are there in using databases as compared to text files.
Database records can relate to other records, which makes management easier.
Updating text files is difficult, and can eventually be very slow when retrieving/updating data.
Retrieving data from a database is very easy, and can involve one, or just a few lines of code, and can get specific results with the SELECT statement.
