Multidimensional arrays are layed out like a rectangle, so each row must have a certain amount of elements. 
Jagged arrays are not layed out like a rectangle so each row can have a different number of elements.

BitArray is used for storing generic bits.
Hashtable allow one to store key/value pairs instead of just having one type within the array.
ArrayList Class is useful because you can change the size and length of the array after it is created so it is more adaptive.
String Class is great for string manipulation and tokenizing/dividing strings up for syntax applications.
Queue, as its name implies, stores data to be processed in an orderly fashion.
Stack uses the Last In First Out data maintanence routing for storing information.
