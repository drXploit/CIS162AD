Provide an example of a constant that might be used in a C# program.
An example of a constant used in a C# program would be pi, because it's an unchanging number.

Explain the difference between floating-point and decimal data types in C#.
Floating point data types must contain a decimal (end in .something) while decimal data types have the decimal as an option (don't necesarrily have to end in .something).
So if the number declared is 0, the float would have to be stated as 0.0, while the decimal could be 0 or 0.0 without any compilation warnings or errors.
Also 128 bits are used for the value of a decimal so there is a larger precision than float.

Explain casting.
Casting means changing types from one to another by implying the type to changing into (type) before the variable. so thisDouble = (double) myInteger; will cast the integer properly into the double in memory. 

What is the purpose of the auto increment and auto decrement operators in C#?
They simplify increasing or decreasing an integer by one without naming the variable twice. E.G "myVariable++;" instead of "myVariable = myVariable + 1;"
